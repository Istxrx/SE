# Bike rental app
**Java 8, JUnit, Pair programming, UML**

This project was a part of SE course two-man team coursework. The goal was to develop an app prototype of a federalised bike rental system that would return quotes for customers
and they could then on its basis make a booking and rent bikes from providers. It means that in this app is included handling of booking, scheduling of delivery service and return of bikes.
This project also contains JUnit tests.
